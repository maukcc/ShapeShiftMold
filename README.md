Unique Fast Forming
====

Unique Fast Forming relies on a 3D scanned object that is immediately transformed to a ShapeShiftMold in seconds, then to a 3D vacuum molded object in minutes. Creating very low cost vacuum forming parts.

Shape Shift Mold
====
ShapeShiftMold is a 3D shape shifting mold that can make ultra low cost vacuum molded parts.

By moving an 2D array of multiple miniature actuators in 1D, we will get a 3D plane that can be used for vacuum forming.
On top and attached to this 3D plane will be a perforated skin to ensure a smooth surface and for the vacuum condition.
A 3D scan is converted to a real 3D plane in seconds, then to a 3D vacuum molded object in minutes.
Creating zero cost vacuum forming.
