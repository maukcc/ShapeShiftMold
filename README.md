Shape Shift Mold
====
ShapeShiftMold is a 3D shape shifting mold to make a zero cost vacuum mold.

By moving an 2D array of multiple miniature actuators in 1D, we will get a 3D plane that can be used for vacuum forming.
A 3D scan is converted to a real 3D plane in seconds, then to a 3D vacuum molded object in minutes.
Creating zero cost vacuum forming.
